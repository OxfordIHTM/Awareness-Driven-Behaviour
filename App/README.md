This tool was developed as part of my dissertation entitled 'Exploring the effects of awareness-driven behaviour on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the Philippines'. This was submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree MSc International Health and Tropical Medicine in the University of Oxford. The research placement was conducted in partnership with the Modelling and Simulation Hub, Africa. 

We used the RShiny Application framework to develop and modify the tool. 

__Important Disclaimer:__ 

All models are simplifications of reality. Whilst every effort has been taken during the development of this tool/model for it to be as accurate and reliable as possible it is important that the user understands that the outputs are a prediction based on the assumptions chosen through the input parameter values. The output of the model should be used to explore multiple scenarios and in combination with a larger evidence base during decision-making.

The appropriate use of this tool/model and its output can contribute to effective policy making, but misuse or misinterpretation of the output can mislead decision-making. Any decisions taken whilst using these tools are the responsibility of the user and no liability whatsoever will be taken by the developers/authors of the tool.
